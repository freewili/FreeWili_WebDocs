# Capturing Audio from Microphone

FREE-WILi has a integrated microphone. The microphone data is captured at a 8000 hz rate. This microphone data is fed to a FFT algorithm for display or provided via the GUIAPI.

The serial menu provides a way to record the microphone to a wav file. A recording can also be triggered by the GUIAPI. These are recorded to the record directory.

The recording time and volume level can be configured in the settings serial menu.

The format of the wave file is compatible with the [sound playback](/gui-screen-buttons-and-lights/making-sounds/) allowing you to play recorded sounds.
